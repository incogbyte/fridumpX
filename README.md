# fridumpX
fridumpX (v0.1) is an open source memory dumping tool and using regex patterns (verify regex.yaml) to grep sensitive information based on these regexs, primarily aimed to penetration testers and developers to verify memory information that contains some sensite information at memory, all those information based on regex patterns ( you can find at regex.yaml file). **FridumpX** uses Frida and  framework to dump accessible memory addresses from any platform supported. It can be used from a Windows, Linux or Mac OS X system to dump the memory of an iOS, Android or Windows application.  are inspired by fridump

The following are the main flags that can be used with fridumpX:

      positional arguments:
      process            the process that you will be injecting to

      optional arguments:
      -h, --help         show this help message and exit
      -o dir, --out dir  provide full output directory path. (def: 'dump')
      -U, --usb          device connected over usb
      -D id, --device id  connect to device with the given id
      -v, --verbose      verbose
      -r, --read-only    dump read-only parts of memory. More data, more errors
      -s, --strings      run strings on all dump files. Saved in output dir.
      --max-size bytes   maximum size of dump file in bytes (def: 20971520)

To find the name of a local process, you can use:

      frida-ps
For a process that is running on a USB connected device, you can use:

      frida-ps -U
